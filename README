This is the README file for the hrms project that deals with
the analysis of high resolution mass spectrometry data.

This code requires a list of name:mz pairs in a csv file. It is
currently named LipidList.csv on my local machine. An example file should have been 
distributed with this code.

Usage in R:

To perform analysis for one sample in R, call the following in the console:

> setwd("<path>")
> source("hrms.R")
> main(filename,rtwin=c(0,60),mzwin=c(200,1800))

With <path> being the directory with files hrms.R, LipidList.csv, and mzXML files and where 
rtwin is the retention time window in sec and mzwin is the mzwindow in m/z units

If you want to run this for all data files in a directory run the following command: 

> files = list.files(".", pattern=".mzXML") # the pattern could be ".mzML" if needed
> system.time(
> for (i in 1:length(files)) {
>   main(files[i],rtwin=c(0,60),mzwin=c(200,1800))
> }
> )
> results <- signals_deviations() 

The last line will produce the csv files signals and deviations in the active directory, which 
puts multiple file's data together into two csv files plus returns the data.frames in the list 
variable "results".

In the output, a value of "NA" means that no data exists in the mass 
spectrum for that target peak. A signal value of "0" means that there is
mass spectral data collected for the target mass, but that it has a signal
value of zero.
